# Project Chimera: Development Plan

This document outlines our approach to developing the AIPageSummarizer Chrome extension using the sidePanel API with Manifest V3.

## Project Overview & Constraints

### Current Understanding

-   Project Chimera is a rebirth of AIPageSummarizer as a Chrome sidePanel extension
-   Currently uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo for summarization functionality
-   Must support Chrome's sidePanel API and follow Manifest V3 requirements
-   Voice API support should be considered for text-to-speech features

### Key Decisions

-   We'll use modern JavaScript (ES6+) without additional frameworks to keep the extension lightweight
-   Testing will be browser-based only (manual testing in Chrome)
-   We'll implement careful AI prompt engineering for accurate summaries
-   Development will follow a phased approach with incremental delivery

## AI Integration Approach

### Prompt Engineering Principles

-   Create precise, consistent prompts that yield predictable results
-   Structure prompts with clear instructions about:
    -   Desired summary length (brief/detailed)
    -   Format style (bullet points, academic, professional, simplified)
    -   Content focus (main points, arguments, key facts)
-   Sanitize and preprocess page content before sending to the API
-   Include prompt templates in a separate configuration file for easy adjustment

### API Integration Strategy

-   Create an abstraction layer to potentially support multiple AI providers beyond OpenAI
-   Implement robust error handling for API failures
-   Add caching mechanism to reduce redundant API calls for previously summarized pages
-   Manage API rate limits and token usage carefully

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

-   Set up the project structure following the design document
-   Configure the build system with Webpack
-   Implement basic Chrome extension architecture:
    -   Manifest.json configuration
    -   Service worker setup
    -   SidePanel registration
    -   Simple content script for text extraction

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Week 3-4)

-   Implement the API client for OpenAI integration
-   Create the basic UI shell with tabs
-   Develop the summary generation workflow:
    -   Full page summarization
    -   Selected text summarization
    -   Format and length controls

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Week 5-6)

-   Add history functionality with Chrome storage
-   Implement UI themes (dark/light mode)
-   Create the settings panel
-   Add copy-to-clipboard functionality
-   Implement context menu integration
-   Add keyboard shortcuts

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 7-8)

-   Text-to-speech functionality using Chrome's TTS API
-   Site blacklisting implementation
-   User-defined settings persistence
-   Notification system for errors and confirmations

### Phase 5: Polish & Optimization (Week 9-10)

-   Performance optimization
-   Bug fixes and edge case handling
-   Chrome Web Store listing preparation
-   Documentation finalization

## Technical Implementation Details

### Chrome APIs to Utilize

-   `chrome.sidePanel`: Core API for our extension's UI
-   `chrome.storage`: For settings and history persistence
-   `chrome.contextMenus`: For right-click summarization
-   `chrome.commands`: For keyboard shortcuts
-   `chrome.tts`: For text-to-speech functionality
-   `chrome.tabs`: For accessing current page content
-   `chrome.runtime`: For message passing between contexts

### State Management

-   Use Chrome storage for persistent data (settings, history)
-   Implement a lightweight event-based system for UI state
-   Avoid complex state management libraries

### Build Process

-   Configure Webpack to optimize bundle size
-   Set up separate development and production builds
-   Implement CSS minification and JS compression for production

## Best Practices to Follow

### Code Organization

-   Follow a modular component-based architecture
-   Use ES modules for code organization
-   Maintain clear separation of concerns between UI, logic, and API

### Performance

-   Minimize DOM operations in the sidePanel
-   Lazy-load features and assets when possible
-   Optimize the content extraction process to handle large pages

### Security

-   Follow CSP best practices for Chrome extensions
-   Securely store API keys using Chrome's storage.local encrypted storage
-   Sanitize content before displaying in the UI
-   Implement proper error boundaries

### Accessibility

-   Ensure all UI elements are keyboard navigable
-   Add proper ARIA attributes to custom components
-   Maintain sufficient color contrast for readability
-   Design with screen reader compatibility in mind

## Implementation Strategies

### AI Model Integration

-   Begin implementation with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo for cost-effective development and testing
-   Design API client with a provider abstraction layer to support potential model upgrades
-   Include configuration options to easily switch between models (3.5, 4, etc.) in the future
-   Research comparative performance of different models for summarization tasks as a stretch goal
-   Add telemetry option (opt-in) to track summarization quality for different models

### API Key Security

-   Review Chrome extension security best practices for handling sensitive credentials
-   Implement in-memory key retention during active sessions to reduce persistent storage exposure
-   Research Chrome's `chrome.identity` API for more secure auth workflows
-   Consider offering multiple security options:
    -   Local storage with encryption
    -   Session-only storage (requires re-entry on restart)
    -   Optional integration with password manager extensions
-   Add clear documentation about security implications of API key storage

### API Key Management

-   Redirect users to the Settings tab on first launch or when no API key is present
-   Provide clear instructions on how to obtain an API key
-   Implement secure storage options for API keys
-   Include validation to ensure API keys are entered correctly
-   Consider adding a "Test Connection" button to verify API key validity

### Usage Management

-   Add basic usage tracking to show users their approximate token consumption
-   Implement intelligent chunking of large documents to optimize token usage
-   Add simple usage statistics in settings panel (summaries generated, approximate tokens used)
-   Include best practices guide for managing costs efficiently
-   Add warning system for unusually large summarization requests

### Content Extraction

-   Implement a multi-stage extraction approach:
    1. Extract visible text using DOM traversal with readability heuristics
    2. Prioritize content within semantic HTML5 elements (article, main, section)
    3. Apply site-specific extraction rules for popular sites
    4. Fallback to selected text when page parsing fails
-   Build in preprocessing to remove navigation, ads, and irrelevant content
-   Include debugging options to visualize what content is being extracted
-   Store successful extraction patterns to improve future performance

### Internationalization

-   Design UI with internationalization in mind (avoid hard-coded strings)
-   Structure the application to support i18n through Chrome's internationalization API
-   Begin with English-only implementation
-   Document string externalization patterns for future translation work
-   Add this as a post-MVP feature for later implementation

## Next Steps

1. Set up the initial project structure
2. Configure the build system
3. Create a minimal viable implementation of the sidePanel API
4. Begin API client implementation for OpenAI integration

This plan will be updated as development progresses and decisions are made.
