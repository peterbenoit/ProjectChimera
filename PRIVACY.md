# Privacy Policy for Smart Digest

**Last Updated:** July 29, 2025

Thank you for using Smart Digest ("the Extension"). This privacy policy outlines
how we handle your data.

## 1. Data We Handle

The Extension requires two pieces of information to function:

- **Your OpenAI API Key**: This is required to authenticate with the OpenAI API.
- **Web Page Content**: The text content of the web page you are summarizing is
  sent to the OpenAI API for processing.

## 2. Data Storage

- **API Key**: Your OpenAI API key is stored **locally** in your browser's
  storage (`chrome.storage.local`). It is **never** sent to or stored on our
  servers or any third-party servers other than OpenAI for API requests.
- **Summary History**: Your summary history is also stored **locally** in your
  browser's storage. This data is not transmitted anywhere.

## 3. Data Transmission

- When you request a summary, the content of the current web page and your API
  key are sent directly to the **OpenAI API** over a secure HTTPS connection.
- We do not act as an intermediary. The Extension communicates directly from
  your browser to OpenAI's servers.

## 4. Data We Do Not Collect

We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, browsing
history, or any other data unrelated to the extension's core functionality.

## 5. Third-Party Services

The Extension uses the following third-party services:

- **OpenAI API**: For generating summaries and analysis. Please review
  [OpenAI's Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy) for
  information on how they handle data.
- **Free Dictionary API**: For word definitions. This service does not require
  an API key and does not handle personal data.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any
changes by posting the new policy in the extension's description or on this
page.

## 7. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on our
GitHub repository.
