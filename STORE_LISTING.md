### A Quick Note on "API Keys" 🔑

To use the AI, Smart Digest needs an "API Key" from a company called OpenAI.

Think of it like a library card for the internet's biggest brain! 🧠

This key allows the extension to talk to the AI. Instead of a monthly
subscription fee, you only pay for what you use, which is usually just a few
pennies per summary. It's a super cheap and fair way to get powerful AI help.

You can get your own key from OpenAI's website. Here's how:

1. **Sign up or log in** at [OpenAI's Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
2. Go to the [API Keys section](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
3. Click "**Create new secret key**" and give it a name (like "Smart Digest
   Key").
4. Copy the key and paste it into the Settings tab in the extension.

That's it! Your key is stored safely in your browser and never shared.

### Your Privacy is Important! 🔒

Your API key and the content of the pages you summarize are kept safe. We never
store your data on our servers. Your information is your own!

For more details, you can read our full [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md).
